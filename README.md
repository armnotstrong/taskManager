        // more detail description of the task
        "Desc": "this is a sample of finding files under the /tmp/ dir", 
        // system command or script or executable program the task should run
        "Cmd": "find", 
        // args list, could using the placeHolder of `$UPLOADFILE$` or `$$Args$$` which will be speicifeid by the next chapter.
        "Args": ["/tmp/"], 
        // progress bar marks generated by program to Stdout.
        "progressMark":["google","unix","Job","One"], 
        // will this program need a uploaded files?
        "UploadFileNeeded":false, 
        //indicate whether user input args are needed.
        "InputArgsNeeded":false 
    },
    "ls":{
        "ShortDesc":"list files the use specified",
        "Desc": "this is a sample of list files in the $dir user specified",
        "Cmd": "ls",
        "Args": ["$$dir$$","$$additionOption$$"],
        "progressMark":["google","unix","Job","One"],
        "UploadFileNeeded":false,
        "InputArgsNeeded":true,
        "InputArgsDesc":[
            {"dir":"which dir to list"},
            {"additionOption":"some args like -al"}
        ] 
    },
    "cat":{

        "Desc": "just cat the file uploaded",
        "Cmd": "./resource/myCat.sh",
        "Args": ["$UPLOADFILE$"],
        "progressMark":[""],
        "UploadFileNeeded":true
    },
    "appendDate":{

}
```

## NOTICE

* User upload file will be stored in `upload` dir.
* Files to be download and generated by the **Task Program** should be in the `download` dir, if you wan't the user to see and download.
* File which user uploaded could be referred in `task.json` Using the PlaceHolder of `$UPLOADFILE$`(there is **one** dollar sign before and after) but be sure that the **Task Program** using the right relative path to accessing the uploaded file.
* If you want use to input args, you should use the PlaceHolder `$$args$$`(there are **two** dollar sign before and after) as args and define a map to descripe the args you want the user to input.
* Uploaded file is limited to just **one** per task yet.
* User input args could be multi.
* PlaceHolder `$UPLOADFILE$` could be a replacer in the arg list.
   for example, if a script named `modify_upload_file.sh` behave that when there is  a file `a.txt` and invoke the script

```bash
   ./modify_upload_file.sh a.txt a.txt.modified 

```
there will be a file named `a.txt.modified` generated under `download/`.

In that case `Args` in `task.json` could be writen like:
```
   ...

   "Cmd":"./resouce/modify_upload_file.sh",
   "UploadFileNeeded":true,
   "Args": ["$UPLOADFILE$","$UPLOADFILE$.modified"],
   
   ...
```
## PS
------
* Some samples are given in the `task.json` by default.
* Concurrently excuting of the same task is not supported yet.
